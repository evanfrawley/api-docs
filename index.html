    <b>Smartsheet API 1.1 Deprecation</b><br/><br/>
    <p>
        Version 1.1 of the Smartsheet API has been officially deprecated as of July 11, 2015 (coinciding with the release of Smartsheet API 2.0). 
        Any new development from that date forward should use Smartsheet API 2.0.
    </p>
    <p>
        Smartsheet API 1.1 will continue to be supported until <b>July 31, 2016</b>, at which time it will be permanently disabled. 
        Documentation for API 1.1 can be found <a href="http://smartsheet-platform.github.io/api-docs-v1" target="_blank">here</a>.
        For information about migrating from version 1.1 to version 2.0 of the Smartsheet API, see the <a href="https://www.smartsheet.com/blog/july-2015-api-v2-launch" target="_blank">Smartsheet API 2.0 Release Notes</a>.
    </p>
</aside>

<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Base URL</strong>:  https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Smartsheet API provides programmatic access to Smartsheet features and data. 
In designing the API, our goal was to make it simple, intuitive, and predictable. 
We do our best to adhere to common open and widely accepted standards, including REST for access, JSON format for the data, and OAuth for Authentication and Authorization. 
This API assumes a good working knowledge of the Smartsheet application UI, concepts and terminology.</p>

<h2 id="restful-architecture">RESTful Architecture</h2>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Resources:

/contacts
/favorites
/folders
/groups
/home
/reports
/search
/serverinfo
/sheets
/sheets/{id}/rows
/sheets/{id}/columns
/sheets/{id}/attachments
/sheets/{id}/discussions
/sheets/{id}/updateRequests
/templates
/token
/users
/workspaces
</code></pre>

<p>Everything in Smartsheet is represented as an object with a defined structure. 
For example, the &ldquo;Home&rdquo; object contains a list of your Sheets, Folders, Reports, Templates, and Workspaces, and a Sheet object contains Columns, Rows, Attachments, and Discussions. 
All aspects of Smartsheet are modeled as structured objects.</p>

<p>URL structure follows typical resource-oriented conventions. For example, to get a list of sheets, use <code class="prettyprint">GET https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets</code>. 
This will return a list of Sheet objects, where each Sheet will have an &ldquo;id&rdquo; attribute. 
To get details on a particular sheet, use <code class="prettyprint">GET https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/123456</code>, where 123456 is the &ldquo;id&rdquo; of the Sheet you want. 
Similarly, to share a sheet, <code class="prettyprint">POST</code> a Share object to <code class="prettyprint">https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/123456/shares</code>.</p>

<h2 id="http-standards">HTTP Standards</h2>

<p>All actions taken through the API are done via HTTP using <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html">standard HTTP methods</a>: GET (to retrieve an object), POST (to create), PUT (to modify), and DELETE. 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html">Standard HTTP Response codes</a> are used to indicate success and error conditions.</p>

<h2 id="input-/-output-format">Input / Output Format</h2>

<p>Unless otherwise specified, all API endpoints expect request body data to be in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a>, and the response body data is returned as JSON.
The following HTTP request headers may be required, depending on the operation and endpoint being invoked:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><em>Content-Type</em></td>
<td>For POST and PUT requests, must be set to the appropriate value (typically <code class="prettyprint">application/json</code>).  Ignored for GET and DELETE requests.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Accept</em></td>
<td>Optional; if not specified, <code class="prettyprint">*/*</code> is assumed (i.e. any response type is accepted), else it must match the output of the invoked endpoint (typically <code class="prettyprint">application/json</code>).</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<aside class="notice">Some of the data returned by the Smartsheet API is user-generated content. Caution should be taken to ensure that the user-generated content is consumed safely in any external system to avoid introducing vulnerabilities.</aside>

<h2 id="example-requests-&amp;-responses">Example Requests &amp; Responses</h2>

<p>For every API operation in this documentation, we show example requests in multiple languages and an example (JSON) response. 
You&rsquo;ll see the examples displayed in the dark blue panel next to each operation. 
To view the sample code in a specific language, select the corresponding language tab along the top of the dark blue panel. 
For more information about using the sample code in this API documentation, see <a href="#sdks-and-sample-code">SDKs and Sample Code</a>. </p>

<p>As with any REST API, you can also test API requests / responses using a Chrome extension like <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo/">Advanced REST Client</a> or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm">POSTMAN</a>. </p>

<h2 id="versioning-and-changes">Versioning and Changes</h2>

<p><strong>Non-breaking changes</strong>: We will be adding new functionality and bug fixes to the API over time. 
You should expect to see new endpoints or new attributes for existing objects. 
Such changes will not result in a new API version.  Please make sure that your code can handle new attributes gracefully. 
Also, please make sure your code does not depend on the order in which records are returned, unless it is explicitly stated in this documentation.  </p>

<p><strong>Breaking changes</strong>: We intend to maintain the current API version for the foreseeable future. 
If and when we decide to add functionality that breaks the contract of the current API, we will publish it with a new version number, so as to keep the existing API functionality backwards compatible.</p>

<p><strong>Deprecations</strong>: Smartsheet occasionally deprecates APIs to indicate that those APIs should no longer be used in active development. 
Deprecated APIs typically remain present and usable for a reasonable period of time following the release in which they were deprecated, but may be removed entirely from a future version of the API. 
You should never use deprecated APIs in new development, and if you have existing code that uses deprecated APIs, we recommend that you update that code as soon as possible. 
For a list of Smartsheet API 2.0 deprecations, see <a href="#deprecations">Deprecations</a>.</p>

<aside class="success">To stay informed about changes to the API, subscribe to our Developer Newsletter (using the <i>Get Developer Updates</i> form on the <a href="http://www.smartsheet.com/developers" target="_blank">Smartsheet Developer Portal</a>) or follow us via <a href="https://twitter.com/smartsheetapi" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</aside>

<h1 id="api-fundamentals">API Fundamentals</h1>

<h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>

<p>The Smartsheet API utilizes OAuth 2.0 for Authentication and Authorization. 
An <strong>Authorization</strong> HTTP header containing an Access Token is required to authenticate requests. 
Access Tokens can be acquired in one of two ways:
<ul>
<li>via the Smartsheet UI (<a href="#user-generated-access-tokens">User-generated Access Tokens</a>) </li>
<li>via OAuth 2.0 (see <a href="#third-party-access-tokens">Third-party Access Tokens</a>)</li>
</ul> </p>

<h3 id="user-generated-access-tokens">User-generated Access Tokens</h3>

<p>Smartsheet users can easily generate Access Tokens by logging in to their Smartsheet account. 
Once a token is generated, it can be used in a script or custom application, or with an API integration service like Zapier, to access any Smartsheet data which the token owner already can access in the application. 
See <a href="#direct-api-access">Direct API Access</a> for more information on user-generated tokens.</p>

<h3 id="third-party-access-tokens">Third-party Access Tokens</h3>

<p>Third-party developers are able to build applications that can acquire Access Tokens using OAuth 2.0. 
See <a href="#third-party-app-development">Third Party App Development</a> for more information.</p>

<h2 id="access-levels">Access Levels</h2>

<p>Throughout the API we have &ldquo;Share&rdquo; objects that represent the shared user&rsquo;s access level. 
Also, on Sheets, Workspaces and Templates, there is an <strong>accessLevel</strong> attribute that describes the current user&rsquo;s access level to that object. 
This corresponds directly to the sharing and access controls of Smartsheet that are available through the Smartsheet UI. 
The <strong>accessLevel</strong> attribute has one of the following values:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>VIEWER</td>
<td>The user has read-only access to the resource.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>EDITOR</td>
<td>The user can edit the resource, but cannot alter the structure of, delete or share the resource.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>EDITOR_SHARE</td>
<td>The same as EDITOR, but with the ability to share the resource to other users.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ADMIN</td>
<td>The user can edit and share the resource, and can alter the structure of the resource as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OWNER</td>
<td>The user has complete control over the resource.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<h2 id="rate-limiting">Rate Limiting</h2>

<p>In order to prevent abuse and undue stress on the Smartsheet servers, the API has a rate limiting feature that restricts users to <strong>300</strong> requests per minute per Access Token. 
Certain resource intensive operations, such as attaching a file and getting cell history, count as 10 requests to prevent abuse of these operations. 
We reserve the right to enforce this limit depending on the load on our systems. 
If and when the limit is enforced, any requests that exceed this limit will be rejected with an <strong>HTTP 503</strong> error code, with the Smartsheet error code <strong>4003</strong>. 
Please design your applications assuming that the stated limit will be enforced.</p>

<h2 id="errors">Errors</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html">Standard HTTP Response codes</a> are used to indicate success and error conditions. Generally, they will follow this pattern:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>2xx</td>
<td>Request was successful</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4xx</td>
<td>Problem with request (malformed or missing a parameter or access denied)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5xx</td>
<td>Request was properly formatted, but the operation failed on Smartsheet’s end</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><strong>Smartsheet HTTP codes</strong>:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>OK</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>400</td>
<td>BAD REQUEST</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>401</td>
<td>NOT AUTHORIZED</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>403</td>
<td>FORBIDDEN</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>404</td>
<td>NOT FOUND</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>405</td>
<td>METHOD NOT SUPPORTED</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>500</td>
<td>INTERNAL SERVER ERROR</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>503</td>
<td>SERVICE UNAVAILABLE</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>All errors will also be accompanied by JSON-formatted error objects, containing a descriptive message. For example, doing a <code class="prettyprint">GET</code> on a non-existent sheet at <code class="prettyprint">https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/123456</code> will result in a response code of <strong>404</strong>, indicating the resource was not found. The body of the response will include an Error object:</p>

<p>{<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&ldquo;errorCode&rdquo;: 1006,<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&ldquo;message&rdquo;: &ldquo;Not Found&rdquo;<br/>
}</p>

<h3 id="symbol-columns">Symbol Columns</h3>

<p>In addition to the basic column types above, the Smartsheet app also supports columns that display symbols. These are simply specialized columns of type PICKLIST or CHECKBOX,
whose <strong><a href="#column-object">symbol</a></strong> attribute is set to one of the values below:</p>

<p><strong>Symbols for CHECKBOX columns:</strong></p>

<aside class="notice">The Smartsheet grid user interface presents several row attributes and features (e.g., row number, attachments, discussions, row action indicator, etc.) visually as columns.  The API does not consider these to be columns, and does not return or otherwise expose them as columns.  The only columns returned by the API are user data columns.</aside>

<h3 id="system-columns">System Columns</h3>

<p>In addition to the standard column types and symbols, Smartsheet has a number of <em>system columns</em>, which represent data that is
filled in by Smartsheet and whose values cannot be changed by the user. These columns are represented with standard
<a href="#column-types">column types</a>, with the <strong><a href="#column-object">Column.systemColumnType</a></strong> attribute set to one of the following:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Column.systemColumnType Value</th>

</tr>
</tbody></table>

<h2 id="cell-values">Cell Values</h2>

<p>Within the Smartsheet web application, all editable column types are flexible and cells in those columns can contain either
a value specific to the column type (e.g. dates, checkboxes, symbols, etc.) or a free-form text value.  This allows for a very
flexible UI and is one of the key benefits to using Smartsheet.</p>

<aside class="notice">See the <a href="#column-types">Column Types</a> section for information on the different column types.</aside>

<h3 id="cell-value-representation">Cell Value Representation</h3>

<p><a href="#cell-object">Cell objects</a> retrieved through the Smartsheet API&rsquo;s have two attributes representing cell values: <strong>Cell.value</strong>, and
<strong>Cell.displayValue</strong>.  An empty cell is always represented by <strong>null</strong> for both.</p>

<p><strong>Cell.displayValue</strong> is always a <strong>string</strong> and is only returned for certain column types (see below).  It represents the formatted value as it should
be displayed to an end-user.  For example, if a TEXT_NUMBER column is formatted as a US Dollar currency, its <strong>value</strong> may be a number
like 1234.5678, but its <strong>displayValue</strong> would be &ldquo;$1,234.57&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Cell.value</strong> represents a cell&rsquo;s raw value and can be one of the following primitive JSON types: <strong>string</strong>, <strong>number</strong>, or <strong>boolean</strong>,
depending on the column type.  Complex types are represented as strings, formatted as described below:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>

<h3 id="cell-value-parsing">Cell Value Parsing</h3>

<p>The flexibility in cell value data types is a powerful feature in the Smartsheet application, but at the same time, it poses a challenge
for an API in terms of parsing. Being too flexible will likely result in unexpected behavior. For instance, if you write code
to post a Date value to a Smartsheet and the API operation succeeds,  you might assume that the date value you sent was interpreted
as date. What happens if you posted your date in the wrong format? Do you really want Smartsheet to keep the malformed date
as a Text value? Probably not.</p>

<p>To address this problem, the Smartsheet API employs a simple scheme to indicate whether you want a more predictable and strict
interface or a more flexible one. By default, a cell value is expected to conform to &ldquo;strict&rdquo; rules for the type of the cell&rsquo;s column.
If an input value doesn&rsquo;t conform, the API will return <a href="#errors">error code 1042</a>.</p>

<p>If, however, you want the same flexibility as the Smartsheet web application, you can disable the strict rules, and we’ll do our best to make
sense of it. To enable lenient parsing simply include <code class="prettyprint">&quot;strict&quot; : false</code> in the <a href="#cell-object">Cell object</a> in your request body.</p>

<p>The parsing rules for the various column types are as follows:</p>

<p><strong>TEXT_NUMBER</strong>:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><em>Strict</em></td>
<td>All numeric and text values are valid and are interpreted literally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Lenient</em></td>
<td>All numeric and text values are valid. Formatted numbers passed as text values, such as currencies (&ldquo;$5,000&rdquo;), percentages (&ldquo;50%&rdquo;), or decimals (&ldquo;100.5&rdquo;)  will be parsed to their numeric equivalents, based on the locale of the Access Token owner,  with the proper formatting enabled for the cell.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<aside class="notice">The Smartsheet application only supports numeric values in the range -9007199254740992 to 9007199254740992. If using strict parsing, any numeric value outside that range will result in <a href="#errors">error code 1148</a>. If using lenient parsing, the value will be silently converted to text.</aside>

<p><strong>PICKLIST</strong>:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th></th>

</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><em>Strict</em></td>
<td>The value must be a string and must be one of the options for the Picklist.</td>

</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><strong>DATE</strong>:</p>

<h4 id="contact-list-columns">Contact List Columns</h4>

<p>With columns of type CONTACT_LIST, cells’ “value” and “displayValue” attributes are treated independently. 
The contact’s email address is represented by <strong>value</strong>, while the contact’s name (and the value displayed in the cell in the Smartsheet app) is represented by <strong>displayValue</strong>.</p>

<p>When creating or updating cells for a contact list column, the <strong>displayValue</strong> attribute works as follows:
<ul>
<li>If <strong>displayValue</strong> is non-null and non-empty, the Smartsheet cell will display the value provided.</li>
<li>If <strong>displayValue</strong> is an empty string, the Smartsheet cell will display the email address.</li>
<li>If <strong>displayValue</strong> is null or absent, Smartsheet will make a best guess effort at filling it in with a contact’s name based on the email address.</li>
</ul></p>

<h2 id="paging">Paging</h2>

<p>The Smartsheet API contains a number of <em>index endpoints</em> (typically denoted in the documentation with titles beginning with &ldquo;Get All&hellip;&rdquo; or &ldquo;List&hellip;&rdquo;) which return arrays of objects.
Examples include <code class="prettyprint">GET</code> <a href="#list-users">/users</a>, <a href="#list-sheets">/sheets</a>, <a href="#get-all-columns">/sheets/{sheetId}/columns</a>, and many others.  These endpoints all support pagination, meaning
you can retrieve paged subsets of results, enabling you to process potentially large result sets in smaller chunks.</p>

<h3 id="paging-query-string-parameters">Paging Query String Parameters</h3>

<p>Index endpoints all support pagination via the following optional query string parameters:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>pageSize</strong></td>
<td>number</td>
<td>The maximum number of items to return per page.  Unless otherwise stated for a specific endpoint, defaults to <strong>100</strong> if not specified.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>page</strong></td>
<td>number</td>
<td>Which page to return.  Defaults to <strong>1</strong> if not specified.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>includeAll</strong></td>
<td>boolean</td>
<td>If true, include all results (i.e. do not paginate).  Mutually exclusive with <strong>pageSize</strong> and <strong>page</strong> (they are ignored if <strong>includeAll</strong>=true is specified).</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<aside class="notice">Most index endpoints default to a page size of 100 results.  If you need all results at once, you should specify the <code class="prettyprint">includeAll=true</code> query string parameter.</aside>

<h3 id="paged-responses">Paged Responses</h3>

<p>Index endpoints all return paged responses via an <strong>IndexResult</strong> object which provides paging metadata that can be used to navigate the full set of pages in the result set:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>pageNumber</strong></td>
<td>number</td>
<td>The current page in the full result set that the <strong>data</strong> array represents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>pageSize</strong></td>
<td>number</td>
<td>The number of items in a page.  Omitted if there is no limit to page size (and hence, all results are included).  Unless otherwise specified, this defaults to <strong>100</strong> for most endpoints.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>totalPages</strong></td>
<td>number</td>
<td>The total number of pages in the full result set.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>totalCount</strong></td>
<td>number</td>
<td>The total number of items in the full result set.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>data</strong></td>
<td>array</td>
<td>An array of objects representing the current page of data in the result set.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<h2 id="bulk-insert-operations">Bulk-insert Operations</h2>

<p>Several endpoints support optional bulk <code class="prettyprint">POST</code> operations which exist alongside the standard single-object <code class="prettyprint">POST</code>.  For these endpoints, you may pass in either a single object, or an array of objects.
Depending on what was passed in, the <a href="#result-object">Result object</a> returned will contain either a single object, or an array.  An example optional bulk operation is <a href="#add-favorite(s)">POST /favorites</a>: you can
pass in a single <a href="#favorite-object">Favorite object</a> to create a single favorite, or an array of Favorite objects to create multiple favorites in a single request.  Endpoints which support bulk operations will be
noted as such in their API reference documentation.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Several <code class="prettyprint">POST</code> operations fail when attempting to create a single object which already exists (e.g. favorites, shares, group members).  However, for the corresponding bulk operations, these endpoints will <em>not</em>
return an error if one or more items in the array already exist.  Existing items will simply be ignored, and <a href="#result-object">Result object</a> returned will omit them.</p>

<aside class="notice">As we make future updates to the API, we may add bulk support to additional endpoints.  Because the endpoints will continue to support single-object semantics, this will not result in a breaking change,
and existing code will continue to function.</aside>

<h2 id="dates-and-times">Dates and Times</h2>

<p>The Smartsheet API returns all dates and times in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">UTC</a> time zone, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO-8601</a> format.  If a date/time needs to be
displayed to an end-user in their local time zone, you will need to do the conversion using the user&rsquo;s time zone which you can obtain by <a href="#get-current-user">getting the current user</a>.</p>

<p>You can optionally choose to receive and input dates/times in numeric format, as milliseconds since the UNIX epoch (midnight on January 1, 1970 in UTC time), using the query string parameter <strong>numericDates</strong> with a value of <code class="prettyprint">true</code>.
This flag works for any API request.</p>

<p>The C# code samples included in this API documentation demonstrate how to execute operations using the <a href="https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-csharp-sdk">Smartsheet C# SDK</a>. 
Each code sample uses a <strong>SmartsheetClient</strong> object called &ldquo;smartsheet&rdquo; that can be created as follows:</p>

<p><code>
// Set the Access Token<br/>
Token token = new Token();<br/>
token.AccessToken = &quot;INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE&quot;;<br/>
</code></p>

<p><code>
// Use the Smartsheet Builder to create a Smartsheet<br/>
SmartsheetClient smartsheet = new SmartsheetBuilder().SetAccessToken(token.AccessToken).Build();

<h3 id="node.js-sample-code">Node.js Sample Code</h3>

<p>The Node.js code samples included in this API documentation demonstrate how to execute operations using the <a href="https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-javascript-sdk">Smartsheet JavaScript SDK</a>, with promises. 
Each code sample uses a root module called &ldquo;smartsheet&rdquo; that can be created as follows:</p>

<p><code>
var client = require(&#39;smartsheet&#39;);<br/>
var smartsheet = client.createClient({accessToken:&#39;INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE&#39;});
</code></p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve created the <strong>smartsheet</strong> variable, you can use it to execute API operations. 
For example, the following code example shows how to execute the <a href="#get-current-user">Get Current User</a> operation.</p>

<p><code>
smartsheet.users.getCurrentUser()<br/>
&#160;&#160;.then(function(data) {<br/>

<h2 id="direct-api-access">Direct API Access</h2>

<p>Smartsheet makes it easy to directly access your data via the API. 
The first step is to generate an Access Token via the Smartsheet UI. 
Users can generate and have more than one active token at any time. 
Access Tokens generated in Smartsheet UI are long lived, meaning they won’t expire for 10 years. 
They are best used in system-level integrations, such as applications designed to keep Smartsheet and other systems in sync, or to integrate with Zapier, ifttt or similar API integration services.</p>

<h3 id="generating-access-token">Generating Access Token</h3>

<p>These instructions assume that you already have an existing Smartsheet account. Follow these steps to generate an Access Token:
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Account</strong> button in the upper-left corner of your Smartsheet screen and select <strong>Personal Settings</strong>.  This will open the Personal Settings form.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>API Access</strong> button to open the API Access form.
<li>Use the API Access form to generate new or manage existing acces tokens.
</ol></p>

<p>Because you can generate and have more than one active token at any time, you have the ability to implement a granular security policy by designating a separate token for each application or integration scenario you may have. 
That way, should any one token become compromised, you can easily revoke it without impacting any of your other API-enabled applications.</p>

<aside class="notice">You will have only one opportunity to view and copy your newly generated token. For security reasons, you will not be able to retrieve it at a later time. If you lose your token, however, it is easy to use the UI to revoke it and generate a new one.</aside>
 

<aside class="success">Access Tokens are essentially passwords and grant the holder access to all of your Smartsheet data. It is imperative that you keep them secure.</aside>

<p>The header name is <b>Authorization</b> and the value of the header is <b>Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN</b>, where ACCESS_TOKEN is a token generated by you. Since the access token is being transmitted in clear text, all API calls are done over HTTPS.</p>

<h2 id="third-party-app-development">Third Party App Development</h2>

<p>In addition to being a powerful work management tool, Smartsheet is a powerful application platform. 
We are committed to making it easy to build applications on top of Smartsheet - whether you are developing a solution for your organization or creating an app for the Smartsheet customer community at large. 
We are here to support you and would love your feedback on how to improve the API and the developer experience.</p>

<p>As a developer, you may be building applications that allow any Smartsheet user to access his or her Smartsheet data. 
Doing so requires that you complete the following steps.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="#developer-registration">Complete your Developer Profile</a> </li>
<li><a href="#registering-your-app">Register your App</a></li>
<li>Within your app, <a href="#oauth-flow">implement a 3-legged OAuth flow</a> to obtain an access token that can be used to access Smartsheet data on behalf of an end user. </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="developer-registration">Developer Registration</h3>

<p>Third party app registration and management is available via the Developer Tools. 
To get access to Developer Tools, you must first <a href="http://www.smartsheet.com/developers/register">register</a> as a Smartsheet developer. 
Follow the instructions on the registration form to add Developer Tools to an existing Smartsheet account or create a new Smartsheet developer account.</p>

<p>Once you complete the developer registration, log in to Smartsheet to access Developer Tools.<br>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Account</strong> button in the upper-left corner of your Smartsheet screen.</li>
<li>Now that you are registered as a Smartsheet developer, you should see a new <strong>Developer Tools</strong> option in the dropdown menu. Select it to open Developer Tools.</li>
<li>Before you can register your first app, you will need to complete your developer profile. Developer profile is a public profile that anyone can access to learn more about you and your applications.</li>
<li>Once your developer profile is complete, you will be able to use <strong>Developer Tools</strong> to register and manage your apps.</li>
</ol></p>

<h3 id="registering-your-app">Registering Your App</h3>

<p>To build a third party app, you must first register it with Smartsheet using Developer Tools:
<ol>
<li>Login to Smartsheet.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Account</strong> button in the upper-left corner of your Smartsheet screen and select <strong>Developer Tools</strong>.</li>
<li>Create new app and provide the required information, including name, description, contact info and a redirect URL. Redirect URL (also known as the &ldquo;callback URL&rdquo;) is the URL in your app where Smartsheet must redirect after authentication is complete.</li>
<li>Use the generated app <strong>client id</strong> and <strong>secret</strong> to connect your app to Smartsheet. See <a href="#oauth-flow">OAuth Flow</a> for details on how to use <strong>client id</strong> and <strong>secret</strong> to do that.</li>
</ol></p>

<h3 id="access-scopes">Access Scopes</h3>

<p>In order to access an end user&rsquo;s Smartsheet data, your application must explicitly ask for specific Access Scopes. 
The Access Scopes enable your app to communicate to the end users what type of operations it will be performing. 
Access Scopes do not override existing Access Level restrictions. 
For example, having the Access Scope of WRITE_SHEETS will not allow your app to update a sheet on which the end user has read-only permission.</p>

<p>The Access Scopes are as follows:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>READ_SHEETS</td>
<td>Read all sheet data, including comments, attachments and cell data</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WRITE_SHEETS</td>
<td>Insert and modify sheet data, including comments, attachments and cell data</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SHARE_SHEETS</td>
<td>Share sheets, including sending sheets as attachments</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DELETE_SHEETS</td>
<td>Delete sheets</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CREATE_SHEETS</td>
<td>Create new sheets</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>READ_USERS</td>
<td>Retrieve users and groups for your Smartsheet organization</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>READ_CONTACTS</td>
<td>Retrieve contacts</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ADMIN_USERS</td>
<td>Add and remove users from your Smartsheet organization; create groups and manage membership</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ADMIN_SHEETS</td>
<td>Modify sheet structure, including column definition, publish state, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ADMIN_WORKSPACES</td>
<td>Create and manage workspaces and folders, including sharing</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<aside class="notice"><b>Additional Info:</b><ul><li>User-generated Access Tokens are granted all of these permissions.</li><li>Third-party apps must request at least one access scope, but should only request the scopes necessary.</li><li>Once a third-party app attains a valid access token, it will be able to execute <a href="#get-current-user">Get Current User</a> operation, regardless of which access scopes were requested.</li></ul></aside>

<h3 id="oauth-flow">OAuth Flow</h3>

<p>Your app must implement a 3-legged OAuth flow to retrieve an access token that can be used to access Smartsheet data on behalf of an end user. 
This process involves the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="#requesting-authorization-from-the-user">Request authorization from the user</a></li>
<li><a href="#obtaining-the-authorization-code">Obtain the authorization code</a></li>
<li><a href="#obtaining-an-access-token">Use the authorization code to obtain an access token</a></li>
<li><a href="#refreshing-an-access-token">Refresh the access token</a> (as necessary)</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="requesting-authorization-from-the-user">Requesting authorization from the user</h4>

<p>To request authorization from an end user, direct your user to <code class="prettyprint">https://app.smartsheet.com/b/authorize</code> with the following parameters through either a <code class="prettyprint">GET</code> or <code class="prettyprint">POST</code>. The parameter values must be URL-encoded:</p>

<p>An access token is valid for one week but you can use the refresh token to obtain a new access token. 
Once you obtain the new access token, you can use it in place of the old one, which is no longer valid.</p>

<p>To do so, you’ll need to make a <code class="prettyprint">POST</code> request to <code class="prettyprint">https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/token</code> with the following parameters:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>

<p>As an org Administrator, you can assume the identity of any user in your organization. 
This advanced feature enables a number of useful business scenarios, such as executing an organization-wide backup or maintaining data attribution when integrating with another system.</p>

<p>Here is how it works. 
Simply add an <strong>Assume-User</strong> header to your call, with the URI-encoded email address of the user whose identity you want to assume as the value. 
For example, if you want to assume the identity of <strong>john.doe@smartsheet.com</strong> and john.doe@smartsheet.com is a confirmed member of your Smartsheet organization, you would add the following header:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">Assume-User: john.doe%40smartsheet.com</code></p>

<p>You can then act on behalf of the user and make API calls as though you were that user.</p>

<p>If you are integrating Smartsheet with another API-enabled system, such as Salesforce, it may be useful to maintain attribution when adding data to Smartsheet. 
For example, let&rsquo;s say you want to add a new row to a Sales Pipeline sheet in Smartsheet whenever your sales team updates a sales pipeline in Salesforce. 
So, if Bob Johnson makes a change in Salesforce, wouldn&rsquo;t it be great to make the new row show up in Smartsheet as if it were created by Bob? 
Specifying the <strong>Assume-User</strong> header API requests allows org Administrators to develop integrations which do just that.</p>

<h2 id="list-all-sheets">List All Sheets</h2>

<p>As an org Administrator, you can get a list of all sheets in your organization, regardless of ownership or whether or not the sheets have been shared to you.

<p>To backup all of the org data, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Get a list of all sheets in your organization.</li>
<li>For each sheet in the list, fetch the sheet (optionally including a list of discussions and attachments) by assuming the identity of the owner of the sheet. (The value of the <strong>Assume-User</strong> header must be the URI-encoded email address of the sheet owner.)</li>
<li>To backup all files attached to each sheet, fetch them one at a time, using your favorite download method. See <a href="#get-attachment">Get Attachment</a> for more information.
</ol></p>

<p>You can use the sheet version number to enable incremental backups. <a href="#get-sheet-version">Fetch the sheet version number</a> and compare it to the last backed up version number (you will need to store the sheet ID and the last backup up version number) - if they are the same, no need to include the sheet in your incremental backup run.</p>

<h2 id="posting-an-attachment">Posting an Attachment</h2>

<p>Like the Smartsheet web application, the Smartsheet API allows uploading files to Sheets, Rows and Comments. 
You can upload a file by performing either a <em>simple upload</em> or a <em>multipart upload</em>. </p>

<p>A <a href="#simple-uploads">simple upload</a> allows you to add a single file attachment to the specified object. 
For example, you can perform a simple upload to upload a file to a <a href="#attach-file-to-sheet">sheet</a>, <a href="#attach-file-to-row">row</a>, or <a href="#attach-file-to-comment">comment</a>. </p>

<p>A <a href="#multipart-uploads">multipart upload</a> allows you to add a single file attachment to the specified object (i.e., attach a file to a <a href="#attach-file-to-sheet">sheet</a>, <a href="#attach-file-to-row">row</a>, or <a href="#attach-file-to-comment">comment</a>), or to create an object and attach a file using a single request. 
For example, you can perform a multipart upload to <a href="#add-comment">create a new Comment</a> that contains a single file attachment or to <a href="#create-discussion-on-sheet">add a new Discussion to a Sheet</a> that contains a single file attachment.</p>

<aside class="notice">Important Notes:<ul><li>Max file size for uploads through the API is currently limited to 30mb.</li><li>Posting an attachment is a resource-intensive operation and incurs 10 additional requests against the rate limit.</li></ul></aside>

<h3 id="multipart-uploads">Multipart Uploads</h3>

<p>A multipart upload request allows you to add a single file attachment to the specified object (i.e., attach a file to a <a href="#attach-file-to-sheet">sheet</a>, <a href="#attach-file-to-row">row</a>, or <a href="#attach-file-to-comment">comment</a>), or to create an object and upload a file using a single request. 
For example, you can perform a multipart upload to <a href="#add-comment">create a new Comment</a> that contains a single file attachment or to <a href="#create-discussion-on-sheet">add a new Discussion to a Sheet</a> that contains a single file attachment.</p>

<aside class="notice">Most programming languages have libraries that can be used to assemble multipart requests.</aside>

<p>A multipart upload request must include the following HTTP headers:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Content-Type</strong></td>
<td>Must be set to <code class="prettyprint">multipart/form-data</code>, and include the boundary string that will separate the parts in the request payload.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Content-Length</strong></td>
<td>The length of the request payload.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The request body of a multipart upload request contains one or more <em>parts</em>, each part containing either JSON or a file to upload. 
The request body must contain at least one part. 
Each part must start with the boundary string specified in the <strong>Content-Type</strong> request header, and must contain the following part headers:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Content-Disposition</strong></td>
<td>Contains the following semicolon-delimited items:<ul><li><code class="prettyprint">form-data</code></li><li><code class="prettyprint">name=</code>&ldquo;<em>part name</em>&rdquo;</li><li><code class="prettyprint">filename=</code>&ldquo;<em>filename</em>&rdquo; (only required for file parts)</li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Content-Type</strong></td>
<td>The content type of the part: <code class="prettyprint">application/json</code> for JSON objects, or the applicable MIME type for file parts</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The last part in the request must be followed by the boundary string, followed by two hyphens.</p>

<p>The documentation for each operation that supports multipart uploads will specify the number and names of parts that are expected for the operation. 
File parts must have the part name &ldquo;file&rdquo;, and documentation for operations which allow for JSON object parts will specify the required part name for the JSON part.</p>

<p>The following example shows a multipart upload request that creates a Comment containing the specified text and file attachment:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">POST https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/4509093797881732/discussions/2889925487028100/comments</code><br>
<code class="prettyprint">Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN</code><br>
<code class="prettyprint">Content-Length: 29008</code><br>
<code class="prettyprint">Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----gU8h01zAAp3LagBr</code>  </p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">------gU8h01zAAp3LagBr</code><br>
<code class="prettyprint">Content-Disposition: form-data; name=&quot;comment&quot;</code><br>
<code class="prettyprint">Content-Type: application/json</code>  </p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">{ &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Please review the attached image.&quot; }</code><br>
<code class="prettyprint">------gU8h01zAAp3LagBr</code><br>
<code class="prettyprint">Content-Disposition: form-data; name=&quot;file&quot;; filename=&quot;picture.jpg&quot;</code><br>
<code class="prettyprint">Content-Type: image/jpeg</code>  </p>

<p><em>&lt; Binary content for file &gt;</em><br>
<code class="prettyprint">------gU8h01zAAp3LagBr--</code></p>

<h3 id="simple-uploads">Simple Uploads</h3>

<p>A <a href="#simple-uploads">simple upload</a> allows you to add a single file attachment to the specified object. 
For example, you can perform a simple upload to upload a file to a <a href="#attach-file-to-sheet">sheet</a>, <a href="#attach-file-to-row">row</a>, or <a href="#attach-file-to-comment">comment</a>. </p>

<p>To perform this kind of upload, you must set specific headers to tell Smartsheet about the file. The following three headers are required: </p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Content-Disposition</strong></td>
<td><code class="prettyprint">attachment</code> to tell the API that a file is in the body of the POST request, followed by a semicolon, followed by <code class="prettyprint">filename=</code> and the filename in quotes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Content-Type</strong></td>
<td>Can be left blank if it is not known (but must be present), and Smartsheet will make its best guess based on the extension of the file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Content-Length</strong></td>
<td>Must be set to the size of the file, in bytes. For example to determine file size using in UNIX: <p><code class="prettyprint">$ ls -l ProgressReport.docx</code><br/><code class="prettyprint">5463 ProgressReport.docx</code></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The following example request shows a simple upload that adds a file attachment to a Sheet:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">POST https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/4509093797881732/attachments</code><br>
<code class="prettyprint">Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN</code><br>
<code class="prettyprint">Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;ProgressReport.docx&quot;</code><br>
<code class="prettyprint">Content-Type: application/msword</code><br>
<code class="prettyprint">Content-Length: 5463</code>  </p>

<p><em>&lt; Binary content for file &gt;</em>  </p>

<p>As shown in this example, the contents of the file is included in the body of the <code class="prettyprint">POST</code> request. In most programming languages, this is done by reading the file from an input stream and writing it out to the output stream of the HTTP request. </p>

<h2 id="update-cell(s)">Update Cell(s)</h2>

<h2 id="related-items">Related Items</h2>

<h3 id="cell-links">Cell Links</h3>

<p>You can create and modify <a href="#celllink-object">cell links</a> by using any API operation that creates or updates cell data. 
Creating or updating cell links via the <strong>cell.linkInFromCell</strong> attribute is a special operation. 
A given row or cell update operation may contain only link updates, or no link updates. 
Attempting to mix row/cell updates with cell link updates will result in error code 1115.</p>

<p>When creating a cell link, <strong>cell.value</strong> must be null (the data will be pulled from the linked cell).</p>

<p>A cell may not contain both a hyperlink and a cell link, so <strong>hyperlink</strong> and <strong>linkInFromCell</strong> may never both be non-null at the same time.</p>

<p>A cell link can only be added to an <em>existing</em> cell, so the <strong>cell.linkInFromCell</strong> attribute is not allowed when POSTing a new row to a sheet.</p>

<h3 id="hyperlinks">Hyperlinks</h3>

<p>You can create and modify <a href="#hyperlink-object">hyperlinks</a> by using any API operation that creates or updates cell data. 
When creating or updating a hyperlink, <strong>cell.value</strong> may be set to a string value or null. 
If null, the cell&rsquo;s value will be derived from the hyperlink: 
<ul><li>If the hyperlink is a URL link, the cell&rsquo;s value will be set to the URL itself.</li><li>If the hyperlink is a sheet or report link, the cell&rsquo;s value will be set to the sheet or report&rsquo;s name.</li></ul></p>

<h1 id="formatting">Formatting</h1>

<p>Formatting data can optionally be included for columns, rows, and cells by adding the &ldquo;include=format&rdquo; query string parameter to any API operation that returns any of those objects (for example, <code class="prettyprint">GET /sheets/{sheetId}</code>, <code class="prettyprint">GET sheets/{sheetId}/rows/{rowId}</code>, etc.).  When this parameter is included, objects that contain non-default formatting will include a <strong>format</strong> property.  Objects which do not have any non-default format settings applied will exclude this property.</p>

<p>Because the amount of format data in a large sheet can potentially be very large in itself, for bandwidth reasons, format data is represented by a compact format descriptor string.  The format descriptor takes the form of a comma-separated list of numeric values.  These values represent indexes into pre-defined format lookup tables which can be retrieved using the <code class="prettyprint">GET /serverinfo</code> operation.</p>

<h2 id="row-&amp;-column-format">Row &amp; Column Format</h2>

<p>Setting the format of a row or column through the API simply sets the baseline format for new cells in that row or column.  It does not affect existing cells.</p>

<p>The equivalent API action for what happens when you highlight a column or row in the Smartsheet web app and set a format (e.g. bold) would be to update the format of a column or row (via <code class="prettyprint">PUT /sheets/{sheetId}/rows/{rowId}</code> or <code class="prettyprint">PUT /sheets/{sheetId}/columns/{columnId}</code>), and update the format for every cell in that row or column.  All of the cells in a row can be updated in one operation (<code class="prettyprint">PUT /sheets/{sheetId}/rows/{rowId}</code>), but there is currently no way to update all of the cells in a column in one operation.  This will be addressed in a future version of the API.</p>

<h2 id="format-descriptor">Format Descriptor</h2>

<p>The format descriptor contains 16 comma-separated numeric indexes.  Each index represents a format style whose value can be found in one of the lookup tables in the <a href="#formattables-object">FormatTables object</a>.</p>

<aside class="notice">Formats which have not been explicitly set are omitted in the descriptor string.  For example, a cell which has been set to bold and italic, but has no other formats applied to it, would have a format descriptor of &ldquo;,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,&rdquo;.</aside>

<aside class="notice">As a convenience, the FormatTables object contains a <b>defaults</b> property which is a format descriptor that describes which formats the Smartsheet web application displays for unset formats.  Your application can use these values to display unformatted cells identically to the Smartsheet web application.</aside>

<h2 id="formattables-object">FormatTables Object</h2>

<p>The FormatTables object is retrieved via the <code class="prettyprint">GET /serverinfo</code> operation and contains all of the lookup tables that the <a href="#format-descriptor">Format Descriptor</a> indexes refer to, as well as a property called <strong>defaults</strong>, which is a Format Descriptor that describes which formats the Smartsheet web application displays for unset formats.</p>

<aside class="notice">Indexes and their values are guaranteed never to change or be removed for a given major API version.  However, new values could potentially be added to the ends of lookup tables.<br/><br/>Because of this possibility, your code should handle the case where a cell might contain a format index value greater than the size of a lookup table your app has loaded.  Your application should check for that case and reload the format tables if necessary.</aside>

<h1 id="deprecations"><span class="customTOCSectionHeading">Deprecations</span></h1>

<p>Smartsheet occasionally deprecates APIs to indicate that those APIs should no longer be used in active development. 
Deprecated APIs typically remain present and usable for a reasonable period of time following the release in which they were deprecated, but may be removed entirely from a future version of the API. 
You should never use deprecated APIs in new development, and if you have existing code that uses deprecated APIs, we recommend that you update that code as soon as possible. </p>
